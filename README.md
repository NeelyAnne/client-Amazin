The main goal of this project was to practice weekly agile sprints by creating an e-commerce product page(s) for 20 items in a very similar theme to the commonly known retail site Amazon.

Each team member contributed to the database, the server, and the client for their own component to ensure a full understanding of a complete stack.

The server can be found here _-_ GitHub Repo = https://github.com/Quaran-Team/server-Amazin .

Amazin is currently not deployed, but includes everything necessary for you to download each repository and run on local host.

This project required us to create the foundation of our app from scratch, not utilizing code generators such as create-react-app. Amazin is written in JavaScript and is configured via webpack and package. json using node modules. We also limited the number of external libraries and frameworks as much as possible, and due to time constraints, some parts are just static mocks while others are fully dynamic.

## **Instructions for Use:**

To run it locally:

(1.) Clone the repository

(2.) Open Terminal or your command line interface of choice and run 'npm install' to download any required node modules

 - If you are unfamiliar with npm visit https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

(3.) Next, run 'npm start' to open up a localhost version in your default web browser 
 
 - it should open to localhost:3000/
 
(4.) Browse

 - Click on any of the product squares to go to that page

 - hit the back button to return to our landing page 

 - or just add /singleItem/1 to the end of the url [localhost:3000/] to see our first item

(5.) (Optional) To see a specific page simply change the number at the end to any between 1 & 20

 - e.g. localhost:3000/singleItem/5 or localhost:3000/singleItem/17

 - Most things will not appear correctly without also having the server (link listed above) running.

(6.) (Optional) 'npm test' will run all the pre-written tests
